# UrCirc
UR Circ is so fucking hard to use. I am creating this repostiroy to store command/progress


### Python version
The default python version should be 3.6.x, which is really low. However, the system does have Python 3.11. To unload the current one and load a new one, use:

```bash
module unload python3
module load python3/3.11.0
```
