# UrCirc
UR Circ is so fucking hard to use. I am creating this repostiroy to store command/progress

### Best Way to Access
The best way to access this shit is using JupyterHub. 
1. Go to: https://info.circ.rochester.edu/#Web_Applications/JupyterHub/
2. Click the "JupyterHub" link in the first sentence.
3. Log in.
4. You have a request window to start a session. I will talk about it detail later. But once you requested your session, it will spawn a JupyterLab, and then you can fuck around.

### Python version
The default python version should be 3.6.x, which is really low. However, the system does have Python 3.11. To unload the current one and load a new one, use:

```bash
module unload python3
module load python3/3.11.0
```
